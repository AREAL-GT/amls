Test Notes:Overall:* Data logging and experimental setup looks to be working as planned* Have a full 3D GPS fix plus dead reckoning in the filterFlight 1: Flew a few meters altitude then straight out and back, axes look like x is forwardFlight 2: Fly straight up and down to determine the altitude axis in the log* Went up and down 3 times* Z axis is altitude, with negative z an increase in altitudeFlight 3: Fly out and back a few times in the direction of the front of the drone* Looks good, but data is in NEDFlight 4: Fly out and back a few times in the direction of the front of the droneFlight 5: Fly side to side a few times in the direction of the side of the droneFlight 6: Side to side then front to back
